# Calculator
The corresponding project provides basic mathematical calculations and currency conversion functionalities.

The landing page contains the calculator view whereas the user is able to navigate to the currency converter view using the top left side menu.

Using the calculator the user is able to execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo operations between int or decimal numbers.
The two last typed numbers and the operation between them are displayed in the primary text area, while a preview of the total calculation is displayed in the secondary text area above. In addition the user is able to clear all inputs using the 'C' key of the keyboard and execute the total calculation using the '=' key.

Using the currency converter the user is able to calculate the preferred currency equivalent based on current and historical foreign exchange (forex) rates published by the European Central Bank. The upper text area provides a dropdown list with the available base currencies, where the user can select the preferred base currency and type the int or decimal number. The lower text area provides a second dropdown currency list, where the user selects the target currency to which the input will be converted to. In addition the user is able to type input in both text areas by using the up and down arrow keys of the keyboard. The active textarea is highlighted with a blue border while the conversion is calculated automatically upon input insertion.
